        <span className='emphasized-item'>Stay Mad</span> is a horde guild
        located on US Area 52 that is focused on mythic progression. Success and
        longevity in this guild rely not only on skill, but on how well you
        interact with others in the group. Many of us have been playing together
        for several tiers, which helps make the guild atmosphere more
        lighthearted and fun while not detracting from our main goal of
        finishing CE every tier and trying to push our ranks.

      <h2>Our Expectations</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most of our expectations are similar to any others you'll be accustomed
        to if you have raided with any mid-tier to high-end group. We do not
        require any alts, but we are certainly not against players keeping up
        with an additional character that may benefit the group for
        boss-specific mechanics. You should plan to get an idea of boss
        mechanics beforehand, come prepared with consumables &#40;mostly just
        pots&#41;, and most importantly you should try to interact with other
        guild members through things like alt runs, mythic plus, or even playing
        other games. We do not require that you play 40 hours per week. Our
        members span a large variety of play time, from those that seem to
        always be on to those you may not see much more than their weekly
        requirements. We just ask that you are keeping up reasonably with the
        group and if there's any specific goal requirements you'll be informed
        in plenty of time to accomplish them.

      <h2>What You Can Expect From Us</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Having a tight-knit group is one of our major appeals and most people
        who join end up staying for a long stretch of time. Some new recruits
        may find this off-putting at first, but we are very open to making new
        friends and try to avoid cliques and bias as much as possible. Our
        officers are also generally very approachable and available outside of
        raid times. At the end of the day we are mostly a group of adults with a
        similar passion that we want to make as enjoyable as possible.
